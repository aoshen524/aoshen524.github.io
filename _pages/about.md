<font color=blue>Biography</font>
</h2>

I'm a fourth year undergraduate student major in theoretical and applied mechanics from <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Tsinghua University</a>. I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/">Hao Zhang</a>(UCSD), <a href="https://minjiazhang.github.io/">Minjia Zhang</a>(UIUC) and <a href="http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang">Jie Tang</a>(THU) in the past.

My research interest focuses on building hardware-efficient and reliable machine learning systems, specifically in the following topics:
<ul>
    <li>Efficient DiT model in training and inference.</li>
    <li>Efficient inference for large language models with sparsity and quantization method.</li>
    <li>Efficient serving system for large foundation models</li>
</ul>

<span style="color: red;">I am applying for the 2025 Fall Ph.D. program in Computer Science focused on maching learning and systems. Please reach out if you think I am a good candidate!  </span> `pianoqwz[at]gmail[dot]com`

    <li>Project: AgentBench, ICLR 2024, 2k+ stars</li>
    <li>This project made me realize the importance of long-text performance of large models in real-world agent applications, which has since become the focus of my research.</li>
