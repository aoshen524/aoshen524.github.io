<font color=blue>Biography</font>
</h2>

I'm a Ph.D. student of CSE at HKUST advised by <a href="https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~kaichen/">Prof. Kai Chen</a>. I also contribute to <a href="https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang">SGLang</a> part-time. I obtained my bachelor's degree at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a> in 2025. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://www.wang-yuke.com/about-me">Yuke Wang</a> at Rice University and <a href="http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~gaomy/">Mingyu Gao</a> at Tsinghua University.

My research focuses on building hardware-efficient and reliable systems and architectures for emerging workloads, specifically in:
<ul>
    <li>Systems and architectures for AI and scientific computing.</li>
    <li>Edge computing.</li>
</ul>
