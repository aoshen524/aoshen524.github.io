<font color=blue>Biography</font>
</h2>

I'm a senior undergraduate student from <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a>, majoring in Computer Information Technology with a minor in Maths. 
Previously, I was a research intern at Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute, fortunate to work with <a href="http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~gaomy/">Mingyu Gao</a> at Tsinghua University from May 2023 to August 2024. Before that, I worked with <a href="https://baijianyang.netlify.app/">Baijian Yang</a> at Purdue University as a research assistant.

My research interest focuses on building hardware-efficient and reliable systems for emerging workloads, specifically in the following topics:
<ul>
    <li>Systems for Emerging AI Workloads.</li>
    <li>Edge Computing.</li>
    <li>HPC for Science.</li>
</ul>

<span style="color: red;">I am applying for the 2025 Fall Ph.D. program in Computer Science focused on maching learning systems and traditional core systems and architecture. Please reach out if you think I am a good candidate!  </span> `shen634[at]purdue[dot]edu`

<ul>
    <li>Project: AgentBench, ICLR 2024, 2k+ stars</li>
    <li>This project made me realize the importance of long-text performance of large models in real-world agent applications, which has since become the focus of my research.</li>
