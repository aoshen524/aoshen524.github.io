</h2>

I'm a research engineer working in OpenAGI Foundation. I also part-time contribute to <a href="https://github.com/volcengine/verl/tree/main/verl">VeRL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang">SGLang</a>. I obtained my bachelor's degree at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a> in 2025. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://www.wang-yuke.com/about-me">Yuke Wang</a> at Rice University and <a href="http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~gaomy/">Mingyu Gao</a> at Tsinghua University.
